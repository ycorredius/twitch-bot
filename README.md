# Twitch Bot
#### What is this?
This is a chatbot I am creating to learn/experiment with. The goal of this bot is to: 
  * Practice interfacing with an outside API.
  * Potentially improve the quailty of people in the twitch enviornment.
  * Have fun with it.
  * Pick up new skills along the way. 

##### My thoughts
  January 13,2023
    Things i think I want to implement: 
    * Custom channel point system that I can control
    * System to bet with channel points
    * Create an overlay or communcation to show channel point used. (Figure out how to create and control overlays)
    * Get Anna to draw some character for overlay. 
    * find program to aid Anna in creation of characters / whatever she can decide.  
    * Create a filter that filters banned words 
    * Create a leader board based on ???
    * Create an overlay for sub goals 
    * Create a recurring message system 
    * Create info command 
    * Create a !project command("this will be updated daily to show what I am currenlty working on and also link to github repo")
    * Add feature to control songs or show current song.
